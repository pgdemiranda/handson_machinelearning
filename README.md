Esse repositório representa o andamento da minha leitura do livro "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" de Aurélien Géron.
Em cada um dos notebooks constam apenas os códigos e as **minhas respostas** para os exercícios. Minhas próprias anotações são privadas e não constam aqui para não quebrar qualquer "fair use" da obra.

O livro se divide em duas partes que, por sua vez, se desdobram em diferentes capítulos, conforme assinalados embaixo:
# Part 1 "The Fundamentals of Machine Learning"
- What machine learning is, what problems it tries to solve, and the main categories and fundamental concepts of its systems
- The steps in a typical machine learning project
- Learning by fitting a model to data
- Optimizing a cost function
- Handling, cleaning, and preparing data
- Selecting and engineering features
- Selecting a model and tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation
- The challenges of machine learning, in particular underfitting and overfitting (the bias/variance trade-off)
- The most common learning algorithms: linear and polynomial regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods
- Reducing the dimensionality of the training data to fight the “curse of dimensionality”
- Other unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, density estimation, and anomaly detection

# Part 2 "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"
- What neural nets are and what they’re good for
- Building and training neural nets using TensorFlow and Keras
- The most important neural net architectures: feedforward neural nets for tabular data, convolutional nets for computer vision, recurrent nets and long short-term memory (LSTM) nets for sequence processing, encoder–decoders and transformers for natural language processing (and more!), autoencoders, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and diffusion models for generative learning
- Techniques for training deep neural nets
- How to build an agent (e.g., a bot in a game) that can learn good strategies through trial and error, using reinforcement learning
- Loading and preprocessing large amounts of data efficiently
- Training and deploying TensorFlow models at scale

Tenho dois objetivos com a leitura desse livros:
1. Melhorar minhas habilidades com Machine Learning;
2. Realizar a certificação de Tensorflow.
